# Weather-Forecast-Using-OpenWeatherMap
This code implements a basic weather application that allows users to search for weather information in a specific city. It utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and presents it in a user-friendly format.

**Key Features:**
  - **City-Based Search:** Users can enter a city name to retrieve weather data for that location.
  - **Data Visualization:** A bar chart is generated using Chart.js to visually represent temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
  - **Error Handling:** The code includes error handling to gracefully handle potential issues during data fetching.
  - **Basic User Interface:** Simple CSS styling provides a clean and user-friendly interface.

**How to Use**
1.  **Obtain OpenWeatherMap API Key:**
      - Create a free account on OpenWeatherMap ([https://openweathermap.org/](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://openweathermap.org/)).
      - Navigate to your account profile and obtain your API key.

2.  **Set Up the Application:**
      - Save the provided code as separate HTML (`index.html`), CSS (`style.css`), and JavaScript (`script.js`) files.
      - Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in `script.js` with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key.

3.  **Run the Application:**
      - Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to launch the weather application.

**Further Enhancements**
  - **Additional Weather Data:** Expand the chart to include more weather data points (e.g., pressure, visibility).
  - **Advanced UI Framework:** Consider using a front-end framework like React or Angular for a more sophisticated user interface.
  - **Geolocation Integration:** Implement geolocation to automatically fetch weather data for the user's current location.
  - **Improved Error Handling:** Enhance error handling to provide more informative feedback to users in case of issues.

**Note:**
This code provides a basic foundation for a weather application. Refer to the OpenWeatherMap API documentation ([https://openweathermap.org/api](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://openweathermap.org/api)) for more details and advanced features.
